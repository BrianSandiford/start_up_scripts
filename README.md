# Bash Automation Scripts

A collection of Bash scripts used to automate common tasks on **Ubuntu** and **Raspberry Pi** systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Scripts Included

### `update.sh`
Automates the process of updating the system by running:
- `sudo apt update`
- `sudo apt upgrade`
- `sudo apt autoremove`

Useful for keeping your system packages up to date with a single command.

### `tmux_script.sh`
Creates a new `tmux` session with a custom window name:
- Starts a detached tmux session
- Names the session and window for easy reference
- Optionally attaches to the session

Ideal for persistent terminal workflows on headless systems or remote setups.
